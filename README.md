This project is basically a flappy bird game but with a seahorse, which is why the game is called Flappy Seahorse!!!!
Basically just like flappy bird, hit the spacebar and weave through the seaweed to get points!!!
The game gets more difficult as score increases as well, to add a little bit of an extra challenge!
